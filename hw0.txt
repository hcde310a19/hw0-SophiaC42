# Description of your program (part 7)

This is an explanation of how to count words in a document. 
A word is a character or group of characters seperated by a space from other character.
Start at the top left of the document. Go left to right along the line, counting up all the words.
when finished with the line, go to the next line, and go back to the far left of the new line.
continue the count of words in that line. coninue going line by line counting words until there are no 
more lines. You have now counted all the words in the document

# Reflection on writing your program (part 8)

I feel fine with writing up a program. It feels weird to be writing it in english, because I kept thinking 
in for-loops and while loops. It usually isnt the coding ideation thats difficult for me.
in Hw0, my real difficulty was in understanding what I need to download, and how the new environments work.
I needed to go to Jae's office hours to get help, but honestly I'm still not sure I understand powershell and gethub.
